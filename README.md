# Sorting-algorithms-in-Java
A project implementing Quicksort, mergesort to sort by a number and compare their performance and insertion and selection sort to sort by name and compare their performance.

Java: openjdk-18
IntelliJ: 2022.2.2 (Community Edition)

Datasets: for the program to run it requires the datasets. To put them create a folder inside the  java project and put the datasets inside. The folder must be called "Datasets" and the datasets must be called: "ascending.txt", "descending.txt", "mini.txt" and "random.txt". If you want to include different datasets you'll have to name them like that or add their name manually in the code.

Once the program is runned. A menu with 2 options appears. One option for each type of sorting, to select one enter the number that appears before each option:

List by name: upon selecting this option, 4 options will appear, each one represetning one datasets, as before enter the corresponding number to select one. After selecting any of the options(except mini) it will prompt the number of shoes you want to be sorted, enter the corresponding number as well to select the amount you want. Finally, after that, it will show you both algorithms that can be run to sort by name, enter the correspinding number and it will sort the shoes by name using the algorithm selected. After that, it will print you all the data sorted and after that the time it took the algorithm to sort it and the program will end. To run any other option run the program again and follow the same procedure.


List by quality: upon selecting this option it will prompt the number of shoes you want to be sorted, enter the corresponding number to select the amount you want. After that it will ask for an algorithm to sort the data(quicksort or mergesort) upong selecting one by entering the number it will sort the data and print it sorted with the time it took to be sorted at the end. To run any other option rerun the programm.
